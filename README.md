Users should read CDS Innovations Terms of Service:

This script allows uses to quickly aggregate T3-tax-form fund distribution information for given CUSIPs and Tax Years.
In my opinion, this script does not violate CDS Innovation terms of service as users are required to run this script
on their own and with no intermediate service or assistance. It's simply a more efficient way to collect the data.
